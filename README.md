Wi-Fi Security Research Project

This project is part of my independent cybersecurity research, focused on analyzing Wi-Fi network behavior in controlled and authorized environments.
The main goal is to study wireless vulnerabilities, client reactions, and stability under specific testing conditions.
All experiments were performed strictly on personal test networks for educational and security-enhancement purposes.

Project Focus
	•	Observing Wi-Fi client behavior in controlled deauthentication scenarios
	•	Studying the 802.11 protocol and packet flow
	•	Identifying weak points to improve wireless security awareness
	•	Documenting results with practical, hands-on testing

Hardware
The implementation was done using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, combined with:
	•	Breadboard
	•	Jumper wires
	•	Tactile switches
	•	OLED display
This setup allowed real-time interaction and monitoring of network behavior during the tests.
